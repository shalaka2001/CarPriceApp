Title: What drives the Price of a Car?

Objective: Develop a predictive model to analyze and quantify the relationship between various features of used cars (such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location) and their market prices. Identify these key factors driving the car prices and help the dealership optimize pricing strategies, inventory management, and sales tactics.

Key Insights:

Top Influential features:
•	Age of the car: Age of the car has a very high influence on the price. Newer cars are generally more reliable, equipped with latest features, making them more desirable and as a result fetch better price.
•	Engine Type: Performance engines 8-12 cylinders(V8-V12) are associated with higher end vehicles and preferred for their driving experience and hence have a high influence on the price. Standard engine(5-6 cylinders) cars may be functional but do not provide the performance benefits that the buyers seek
•	Fuel Type: Diesel powered vehicles are favorable likely due to their durability and fuel efficiency. Electric cars may fetch a better price, however buyers do not have a high affinity for them probably due to their limited availability or concerns over infrastructure. Gasoline powered vehicles are more common, however they are not seen as valuable compared to alternatives like diesel or electric.
•	Drive: Four-wheel drive and Rear-wheel drive are preferred over the Front-wheel drive due to their performance benefits, improved traction and off-road capability.
•	Odometer reading: Higher mileage correlates with wear and tear, reducing the car’s lifespan, hence a lower odometer reading is preferred by the buyer

Moderately Influential features:
•	Condition of the vehicle: New or like new condition fetch a higher price, buyers also appreciate the value of fair-condition vehicles if they are priced reasonably and are affordable. The dataset had 22% cars in good condition, however they have a negative influence on the price indicating that they may be overpriced or not much valued by the buyers compared to features like age. The dealership should look at making the excellent and good condition cars affordable and have a better pricing strategy.

Low influential features:
•	Title Status: Vehicles with clean title or lien status increases the value of the vehicle as it more reliable and easier to resell. 
•	Transmission: Manual transmission or specialized transmission vehicles may be favored by enthusiasts or buyers looking for better performance and may yield a better price. Automatic transmission cars are more common and hence are perceived as less valuable.
